These are my dot files. They might be of some use to you, but again, they might
not.

In order to setup a new machine run:

```
make install
```

Running this command will:

  - Install packages and formulas (from `brew`, `pip`).
  - Install a minimal `vim` configuration.
  - Link all the dotfiles to their expected location in `~`.

## Notes

You can save your HomeBrew configurations using the ```brew bundle dump``` command.
